## Getting Started

To get started with running the tests locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

You can clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/logangaabriel/ux-testing-cypress-axe.git
```

Replace `https://github.com/logangaabriel/ux-testing-cypress-axe.git` with the URL of the GitHub repository. You can find this URL by clicking on the "Code" button on the repository's GitHub page.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory in your terminal using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd ux-testing-cypress-axe
```

Next, install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager). Run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary packages and dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

### 3. Run the Tests

After installing the dependencies, you can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will execute the test suites defined in the project using Cypress. It will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run individual tests or the entire test suite.

### Additional Notes

- Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before running the above commands.
- Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to clone the repository and install dependencies.
- If you encounter any issues during the process, refer to the project's README.md or documentation for troubleshooting steps.

That's it! You should now be able to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the tests locally on your machine.

# UX-Based Testing with Cypress-axe

This repository contains automated tests for a simple contact form, focusing on User Experience (UX) principles inspired by Donald Norman's book. The tests aim to ensure that the contact form provides a seamless and intuitive user experience, aligning with the principles outlined in Norman's work.

### Why UX Matters

Donald Norman's book emphasizes the importance of designing user-friendly interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use. By applying UX principles, we aim to create interfaces that meet users' needs and expectations, ultimately enhancing their overall experience.

### Test Objectives

The tests cover various aspects of the contact form to ensure it aligns with UX principles:

1. **Visibility and Usability**: Confirm that essential elements, such as the submit button, are visible and functional.
2. **Feedback**: Provide clear and meaningful feedback to users throughout the interaction, such as success and error messages.
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the form is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by using tools like Cypress-axe for accessibility testing.

### Utilizing Cypress-axe

[Cypress-axe](https://github.com/avanslaars/cypress-axe) is an accessibility testing plugin for Cypress that integrates the axe-core library. By incorporating Cypress-axe into our testing suite, we can automatically identify and address accessibility issues within the contact form, promoting inclusivity and compliance with accessibility standards.

## Conclusion

By conducting UX-based testing inspired by Donald Norman's principles and leveraging tools like Cypress-axe, we aim to create digital interfaces that prioritize user needs, enhance usability, and promote accessibility for all users. These tests not only validate the functionality of the contact form but also contribute to the development of user-centered design practices.
